To enable verbose logging in order to troubleshoot issue(s), set the `DOTNET_CLI_CONTEXT_VERBOSE` environment variable to `true`

_PowerShell:_
```PowerShell
$env:DOTNET_CLI_CONTEXT_VERBOSE = 'true'
```

_Cmd:_
```cmd
set DOTNET_CLI_CONTEXT_VERBOSE=true
```

## <a name="70"></a>70 - Unexpected internal software issue

Unexpected result or issue. [File a bug](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/issues/new?title=Unexpected%20Internal%20Software%20Issue%20(EX_SOFTWARE)) if you encounter this exit code.

This is a semi-standardized exit code (see [EX_SOFTWARE in /usr/include/sysexits.h](https://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/master/include/sysexits.h#L107))


## <a name="73"></a>73 - Can't create output file.

The operation was cancelled due to detection of an attempt to perform destructive changes to existing files. This can happen if you are attempting to instantiate template into the same folder where it was previously instantiated under same target name (specified via `--name` option or defaults to the target directory name)

_Example:_
```console
> dotnet new console

The template "Console App" was created successfully.

Processing post-creation actions...
Running 'dotnet restore' on C:\tmp\tmp.csproj...
  Determining projects to restore...
  Restored C:\tmp\tmp.csproj (in 47 ms).
Restore succeeded.

> dotnet new console

Creating this template will make changes to existing files:
  Overwrite   ./tmp.csproj
  Overwrite   ./Program.cs

Rerun the command and pass --force to accept and create.

For details on current exit code please visit https://aka.ms/templating-exit-codes#73
```

Destructive changes can be forced by passing `--force` option

This is a semi-standardized exit code (see [EX_CANTCREAT in /usr/include/sysexits.h](https://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/master/include/sysexits.h#L110))


## <a name="100"></a>100 - Instantiation Failed - Processing issues

The template instantiation failed due to error(s). Caused by environment (failure to read/write template(s) or cache) or 

## <a name="101"></a>101 - Invalid template or template package

_Reserved for future usage - described behavior is yet not implemented. [Feature is tracked](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/issues/4801)_

Caused by errorneous template(s) (incomplete conditions, symbols or macros etc.). Exact error reason will be output to stderr.

_Examples:_

Missing mandatory properties in template.json
```json
{
    "author": "John Doe",
    "name": "name",
}
```


## <a name="102"></a>102 - Missing required option(s) and/or argument(s) for the command

_Reserved for future usage - described behavior is only partially implemented. Some cases that should fall under this exit code are now leading to code [127](#127) [Issue is tracked](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/issues/4806)_

The exit code is used when one or more required options or/and arguments used for the command were not passed. Applicable to `search` command with not enough information as well.

Applicable as well if template option [marked as required](Reference-for-template.json.md#isrequired) was not passed during the template instantiation.

_Examples:_
```console
> dotnet new my-template
Mandatory option '--MyMandatoryParam' is missing for the template 'My Template'.
